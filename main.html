	<h1>Time & Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, expressed as a function of the length or size of its input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how its execution time scales as the input size grows.</p>
	<p>for example Linear Search Algorithm which is used to search a value in a list/Array has a <b>Time Complexity</b> of <b>O(n)</b> and <b>Space Complexity</b> of <b>O(1)</b></p>
